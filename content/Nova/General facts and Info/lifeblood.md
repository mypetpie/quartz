lifeblood is essentially this game's word for "mana". To use the [[Magic]] of your spear, you need to have enough lifeblood to cast a spell. If you were to analyze the magical items as high-tech weaponry that nobody understands, then the lifeblood is like fuel for the weapon. It does not replenish, and VERY VERY FEW stores across the game sell refills. Generally, if you want a refill, you have to visit [[the Well]] itself and fill bottles with it. However, there exists the possibility of some [[wells]] as told through texts found in various [[Libriaries]] within the walls of [[The University]] cities. [[wells]] which contain great treasure and perhaps even lifeblood itself.
