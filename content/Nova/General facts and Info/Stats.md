As you progress through the game, the various tasks you can perform, such as combat, climbing, running, carrying heavy objects, lockpicking, sneaking past guards, etc. level up a variety of corresponding stats that generally make the thing you're trying to do easier. For more specific information please see the list of stats and what they affect down below:

note: two and one-handed weapons will probably have to be changed to match the broader variety of weapons...should a character who plays w a two-handed spear the whole game really be able to weild a two-handed Cleaver with the same ability?

Agility: How much stamina you have - i.e. How many times you can swing without getting tired.

Dexterity: How fast you can swing your sword and reload ranged weapons. 

Strength: Carrying capacity. Goes up more depending on whether youre near, at, or over capacity.

Two-Handed Weapons: Effects two-handed weapon damage. Goes up the more you use two handed weapons like the [[Cleaver]], or a [[Katana]]. 

One-Handed Weapons: Effects one-handed weapon damage. Goes up the more you use one-handed weapons like the [[Hand Axe]] or [[Short Sword]]. 

Ranged Weapons: Effects ranged weapon damage. Goes up the more you use ranged weapons like the [[crossbow]] or the [[Longbow]]. 

Heavy Armor: Effects your heavy [[armor rating]] - i.e. how much damage your armor will block in addition to its [[Armor Quality]] rating which provides it a base value. The skill goes up whenever you get beat up in heavy armor such as the [[Knight Armor]] set. 

Light Armor: Effects your light [[armor rating]] - i.e. how much damage your armor will block in addition to its [[Armor Quality]] rating which provides it a base value. The skill goes up whenever you get beat up in light armor such as the [[Mage Robe]]  or [[Desert Bandit Armor]] set. 

Lockpicking: Effects how easily you'll be able to lockpick. Not really sure how this one's gonna work yet bc im not sure how lockpicking will work, BUT as you lockpick more the skill goes up and it gets easier to lockpick.

Stealth: Effects how easily you will be spotted when trying to sneak around guards.
