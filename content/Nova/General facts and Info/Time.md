the game takes place roughly 3 or 4 thousand years after whatever events caused the previously very clearly technologically advanced society to collapse, and turn the wasteland into a ruin. The societies that exist today exist in the shadow of the ones that existed in the shadow of the one that collapsed - where even the [[Mechaknights]] have almost no memory of the times before this apparent collapse, only fleeting glimpses that bring with them overwhelming emotional pain when they visit certain locations.
