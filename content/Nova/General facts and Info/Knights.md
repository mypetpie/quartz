"Knight" is a generic term for a locally employed member of an order of usually human men within either the [[Confederation of Free Cities]] or [[The Kingdom of Man]]. For more specific information on which orders govern which lands, see the information outlined in each of these faction's tabs. 

Theoretically, these humans are supposed to be the absolute pinnacle of honor and "goodness" within society - the model person if you will, noble defenders of the innocent and deliverers of swift justice to society's enemies. In practice, however, most of the time these guys are the biggest assholes in the realm. At best they act like crooked cops that can be bought for a surprisingly small fee, and at worst they are racist, misogynist terrorizers of whatever fief they happen to be working on.

Some knights are employed directly by the governments of the faction, for instance [[The God-Hand]] of [[The Kingdom of Man]], and act as local police forces, or just general military soldiers. But the vast majority of people referred to as "knights" are just mercenaries whose entire lives revolve around being paid to spill blood.

There are a couple of different "styles" of knight around the continent. Below are physical descriptions of all of them: 

[[The God-Hand]]:

These guys wear what appears to be extremely expensive full steel plate armor, not entirely unlike a medieval knight on Earth. Their helmets are a bit like Solaire's helmet from Dark Souls, but the rest is very stereotypically "knight"-y. For weapons, they often carry the very big two-handed [[Cleaver]], or occasionally some kind of [[Spear]] or other long-range melee weapon, depending on what type of combat they may be engaging in. For instance, a soldier working guard in a city controlled by [[The Kingdom of Man]] might carry with him a spear instead of a sword, so that he might have an easier time simply piercing his opponents and taking them down at range rather than engaging in combat with them. 

This plate armor, while expensive, is often not that great. Knights of the God-Hand only get one set of armor in their entire life, and there are so many of them 

[[Order of the Sun]]:

These guys dress very similarly to classic centurions, wearing mostly leather or simple mail armor and carrying a [[Short Sword]] or [[Spear]] along side a massive [[Tower Shield]] bearing the [[Confederation of Free Cities]] classic sun emblem.
