An ancient, poorly understood and extremely small (nearly non-existant lore wise) race of machine-people of indeterminate origin. Very few of them are left, partially because the technology they require to stay alive is basically non-existent on Nova, and partially because their apparently infinite lifespan has caused many of them to go mad and revert to a "wild" state. As such, the ones you might com across while exploring are very old, rusty creatures, that posess a great deal of wisdom and intelligence. The University's highest ranking mage, a title I do not have the name for yet, is a Mechaknights. Almost all of the remaining Mechaknights live solely within the University as scientists and mages. They don't tend to travel outside of the [[The University]] much in either direction, be it the Rainforest or [[The Kingdom of Man]], because if they get injured or seriously damaged there is almost no way to repair them without extremely expensive and dangerous tech that is hard to come across. 

Unfortunately, none of them remember what came before the [[Age of Fire]], or the [[Age of Man]]. Instead, all they posses is a deep longing for the beauty of what came before. Many Mechaknights tend to be very pessimistic and stubborn as a result of this - and generally they don't like humans. Occasionally, when you come across certain sites with a mechaknight in your party, they will mention something about what it likely was before the Age of Fire, as if they've had some kind of flashback to a past they can never return to. 

Nevertheless, there are some Mechaknights that have been known to travel alongside groups of human explorers into the Rainforest, and when they do it can be a major benefit for the group because Mechaknights dont have to worry about [[Moss Sickness]] and are generally much stronger and more talented at combat than the average human. 

"Wild," or [[Feral Mechaknight]]s, should be treated with extreme caution - if you come across them in your travels, the best advice anyone can give you is to turn the other way and pray they haven't noticed you yet, lest the rest of the [[Mechaknight Hoarde]] be alerted to your presence.

Mechaknights receive a bonus in strength XP gain and weapon skill.


Physical desc:

First and foremost, these guys are *ancient*. This means that they are all often *very* rusted looking, or they have lots of exposed wiring, and everything like that. They are like metallic skeletons almost, hunks of moving metal with feelings. 

These guys look basically something akin to a mix between the orange one from daft punk and chappy - a blinking black screen represents their face and expressions. Their bodies are all humanoid, resembling something of a very sturdy or strong person. Their heads are occaisionally slightly different shapes, but they are all mostly (or vaguely) humanoid headshapes.
