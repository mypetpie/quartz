The Life-Tree is thought to be both the literal and symbolic giver of life to the [[Rainforest]]. In the book "[[Dawn of the Age of Fire]]", it is also cited as the final resting place of the two goddesses that originally maintained peace throughout the land. As such, it is without a doubt the most important religious site for not just [[The University]], but basically everyone through out Nova. 

Many of the beliefs that people have regarding it change based on what faction they come from. For instance [[The Kingdom of Man]], locked in an eternal battle with [[The University]], wish to cut it down for good and prevent the two goddesses from being reborn, thus permanently keeping the land in what they call an [[Age of Man]] and preventing [[Rot]] from taking place.
