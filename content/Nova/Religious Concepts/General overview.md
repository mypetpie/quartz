This note is a broad overview of the general religious concepts found throughout society. In order to keep things consistent, I am leaving this here as a summary of how I want each faction's religious beliefs to look. 


Generally, [[THE UNIVERSITY RELIGION]] believes that in the beginning of the history of the continent, the whole continent was [[Rainforest]]. [[Human]]s, [[Mechaknights]], and [[Halflings]] all lived in harmony under the rule of two goddesses ([[Dawn of the Age of Fire]]), who were slain by an evil ruler named [[Malias The Brutal]]. When they were killed, their bodies were cast back into [[the Well]], and from their corpses and the [[lifeblood]] in the well sprouted the [[Life-Tree]], which they think is where the two goddesses will one day return to them. This area is now the heart of the capital city of [[The University]].  [[THE UNIVERSITY RELIGION]] believes that at one point, there were multiple wells which provided [[lifeblood]] to the entire continent, and allowed the whole continent to be [[Rainforest]], but that the first [[The Kingdom of Man]] buried or destroyed them all during the time that came before the [[Age of Fire]] to make space for their burgeoning empire, as well as use up more of the resources of the land. They are fighting to maintain what little of the rainforest still exists, in the hope that one day in the (hopefully near) future, their goddesses will return to them at the [[Life-Tree]] and restore peace and balance to the land. They believe that the natural order of things should be that the Rainforest regrows to encompass Nova, and the humans who don't adapt to that must be reclaimed along with the rest of the desert, because they do not deserve to be here if they can't exist in harmony.

The [[KINGDOM OF MAN RELIGION]] believes, basically, that their first Imperator, [[Malias The Brutal]], was a wonderful and generous man who wanted to protect his kingdom in the name of [[INSERT KINGDOM OF MAN GOD NAME HERE]] and ensure the survival of his species. They believe that they are the true rightful rulers of the land, and that the [[Rainforest]], which is poisonous to humans, needs to be burnt down completely in order to keep mankind the dominant species. They think that [[Solip]] and [[Pilos]] are a pair of demonic goddesses that are like the devil to [[INSERT KINGDOM OF MAN GOD NAME HERE]], and that the "[[Rot]]" they spread needs to be eliminated with great fury. To them, the [[Halflings]] were gifted to them by [[INSERT KINGDOM OF MAN GOD NAME HERE]] through [[Malias The Brutal]], and the [[Mechaknights]] are the brutal, horrifying, heretical demon soldiers of the demon queens that need to be stamped out. They resent any and all "magic," and anyone who is found to be in possession of anything even remotely magical (read: prosthetic limbs, magic staffs, certain books) is deemed a "heretic." Naturally, this means they execute or enslave [[Mechaknights]] and disabled people (who haven't hidden their artificial limbs) on the spot.
