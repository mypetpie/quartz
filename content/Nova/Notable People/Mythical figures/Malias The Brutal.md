Malias The First, (as referred to in [[Dawn of the Age of Fire]]), also referred to in [[Dawn of the Age of Man]] as Malias the Great, is presumed to have been the first ruler, or [[Imperator]], of the [[The Kingdom of Man]]. Sources on his life and exploits greatly differ between beliefs, but one thing many people are sure of across the wastes is that it is he who is responsible for the dawn of the [[Age of Man]], be it for better or worse.
