"I'd love to just leave with you for free, but I've run into a little bit of trouble with the local nobility, and if I try to leave without at least paying my bounty, they'll kill both of us..probably should've led with that, sorry."

A researcher and scholar with [[the University]], and author of the popular book series [[A University Student's Guide to the Rainforest]].  Interestingly enough, if you ask him whether or not he's actually been to the [[Rainforest]], he'll start to get defensive, asking why you would want to know that and why you would ask, then he'll say "listen.. its a long story, and you wouldn't believe me anyway." This is a reference to the [[Legend of the Moth Cult]], a field log written by Kiryu that you can locate in some University [[Libriaries]] which describes a cult apparently centered around some kind of giant moth creature located deep within the [[Rainforest]].



Usefulness:
Recruiting him can be very useful if you are new to the game and looking to learn a little bit more lore, as his previous life as a scholar gives him a significant amount of dialogue while exploring ancient [[ruins]] and other places around 


Places he might spawn:
[[Sand]]
