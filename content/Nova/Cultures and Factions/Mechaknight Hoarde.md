A hive-minded group formed entirely of [[Feral Mechaknight]]s and other [[Mechaknights]] in various states of mental and physical decay. Their homeland is located in the [[Wastelands]] biome, in the north eastern corner of the [[Rainforest]]. This faction fights for no known purpose or goal, except apparently to eradicate all sentient life. Very little is known about how they are structured, or whether there is any organization to them at all. The only thing that is confirmed is the presence of a [[Hoarde Queen]], who's only confrmed role is to facilitate the ritual that binds every [[Feral Mechaknight]] together. 

When a Mechanite begins to lose their sanity, they start to feel an insatiable need to travel to the [[Wastelands]], a small region located in the north-eastern region of the jungle that, for one reason or another, has remained covered in ash, dust, and darkness for as long as written history has been around. Upon arriving, they undergo some kind of mysterious ritual given to them by the [[Hoarde Queen]] that allows them to telepathically communicate with other members of their kind anywhere across the [[Map]] - this effectively means that where there's one member of the hoarde, there can be many members. As such, most people do not survive encounters with them, and very little is known about them.
