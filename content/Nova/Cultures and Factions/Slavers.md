One of the many sub-factions of the [[Trade Guild]] - they employ the use of [[Head Hunters]] and other [[mercenaries]] to capture poor and weak people for use in one of the many mining [[outposts]] that the Kingdom controls. Slavery, and the threat of it, is such a worry for most citizens within the Kingdom that they often don't dare to ever leave their home cities - making them a much more easy population to manipulate. If you commit a crime within the Kingdom, its far more likely that you'll get given to these guys than you will get a prison sentence. This makes them one of the most wealthy and powerful arms of the [[Trade Guild]], and thus they have a serious amount of political and social capital within the Kingdom, to the point where slavery has become seen as basically a moral necessity by those living within it.
