"Even [[Shops]]-owners that AREN'T members of the Trade Guild, do business with the Trade Guild. It's what fuels their ability to worm their tight fists into even the most free of places."
-[[Fuu]]

"See, the Trade Guild is like [[Moss]]. Let even the faintest speck of their influence in, and you're dead before you can even say 'achoo.' "
-[[Baba]]

The Trade Guild is, first and foremost, responsible for all of the money flowing in and out of [[The Kingdom of Man]] - it is illegal to own a shop within their territory if you are not a registered member of the Trade Guild, and the [[Master Trader]] is second in authority only to the [[Imperator]] himself. As such, they also control the vast majority of the wealth all over the continent, and the very loose and very grey morals that govern them basically means that in every city you find in the game, there is at least one shop run by the Trade Guild. Politically though, they hold very little control outside of the Kingdom - although how little and how much they influence the politics of the surrounding regions is often hotly debated by many characters within Nova. See the relations tab of this section for more information on that. 

Symbolically, since this is a note to myself, the Trade Guild represents the moral evil of capitalism: most members of the Trade Guild are nothing but slimy crooks, scammers, and deplorable people who will do absolutely anything and step on absolutely anyone to make a dollar. This is what makes them so widely hated by people living outside the Kingdom, many of whom were forced to escape the clutches of [[Slavers]], Debt Collectors, and [[The God-Hand]], all of whom are either directly under the control of (slavers and debt collectors), or have been completely corrupted by, the Trade Guild. This doesn't stop basically any of the major factions from welcoming them into their cities though, and as such their moral evil has basically squirmed its way into every corner of the continent, with the very big exception of the [[The University]], which explicitly outlaws certain practices such as those used by [[Head Hunters]] and other [[Slavers]]. It is the only faction that you will for sure not get captured or sold into slavery in - as even the [[Confederation of Free Cities]] , despite having outlawed slavery for humans within its own borders, allows [[Head Hunters]] to capture "known targets"(often bullshit made up charges) and wanted/good slave material [[Halflings]], as well as buy prisoners from them, to be sent back to one of the many slave camps controlled by [[The Kingdom of Man]]. More about how exactly the relationship between the [[Confederation of Free Cities]] and the Trade Guild works can be found in the [[Constitution of Free Cities]].
