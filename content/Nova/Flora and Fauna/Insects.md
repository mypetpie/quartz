Basically, there are a few broad categories of insect that exist in Nova. They are mimics, hunters, swarm insects, and hive insects. 

MIMICS:
Mimics use camouflage, vocal mimicry, or some other kind of trap in order to lure unsuspecting humans and halflings into their presence. From there, these things usually quickly overtake their victim by means of great haste and strength in a speedy but short battle. 

HUNTERS:
A "hunter" insect is any type of insect that lives alone or in a small group but does NOT employ the use of some kind of trick in order to hunt their victims - instead preferring to "hunt" for them in some fashion. Be they massive [[Desert Scorpions]], who wander aimlessly through the desert like massive tanks and rely on brute force to kill their opponents, or the sneaky [[Mosquitos]] that lie in the tall grassy areas of the [[Plains]], hunters are anything that kill their prey in a more generic, 1-1 combat sort of way.

HIVE INSECTS:
A hive insect is any insect that lives within a large colony, such as [[Fire Ants]]. These insects never go beyond their colony/hive's boundaries, and will only attack people when they come too close to those boundaries. But
