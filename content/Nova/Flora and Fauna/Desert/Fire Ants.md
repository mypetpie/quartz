Hive insects that build massive, complex colonies in the desert, often referred to as "ant-hills". Generally as long as you don't stray too close to an ant-hill, you will be fine, but the swarming of these insects can be very difficult for large player squads that aren't HEAVILY armed to deal with. While one of these things may not be difficult to kill on its own, it often feels as though for every one you kill there are at least a dozen more to take its place, constantly trying to bite through your characters' armor. 

Many a traveler has become overwhelmed when trying to get too close to an [[ant-hill]], swarmed by the hordes of fire ants that dwell there. Why get too close to these, you might be wondering? Well, inside the colonies is a massive collection of the wealth of all the travelers that have ever passed through there. Its basically like a giant loot cave of the corpses of (in lore) hundreds of soldiers. In addition to that, many of these hive colonies are built upon ancient [[ruins]] and other types of abandoned structures, which makes them good sources for people looking to do some research, or score some [[Magic]]al artefacts.
