Little is known about what came before the Age of Fire - it is the only age society has known for its entire written history. The only sources that explicitly discuss an age different from that of Fire or Man are a few religious texts - notably one from [[the University]], and one from the Empire. Though there is much they posess in common, in fact they each tell a very different story. This makes it difficult to discern the truth of the matter - and when one considers topics such as the origins of the [[Mechaknights]], things become even more complex. Furthermore, travel and exploration within the ever-growing [[Rainforest]] is extremely difficult, leaving many of these ancient ruins unexplored - though that does not stop people from trying. Indeed, it is said by some explorers that perhaps some of these [[ruins]] are not meant to be found, guarded by ancient entities and shrouded in a mystery that does not wish to be solved. Researchers and [[Mage]]s from [[The University]] pay a high price for looted goods from such places.   


What follows is a copy of the original book, [[Dawn of the Age of Fire]], written by the very first [[Archmage]]:

In the beginning, there was only the great Rainforest. It was very unlike the Rainforest of today, as it was populated mostly by Halflings, and far less dangerous. It was beautiful, and the whole continent was full of life, supplied by the many [[the Well]]s which now lay buried somewhere beneath the sands.

Long before the dawn of the Age of Fire, two goddesses ruled over this Rainforest in perfect harmony.

The first was [[Solip]], Queen of the Halflings, who's energy was so bright that it lit the very world around her. It was her who first brought
[[lifeblood]] to her people, at the cost of her vision. This is said to be the very blood of the realm which provides life to the [[Rainforest]], and ushered in the First Peace which allowed the two goddesses to rule. 						(note: write poem about how "magic" was brought to people. Maybe certain witches/wizards should be blind ?)
The second was [[Pilos]]. Her silver tongue was said to be capable of felling even the most stern among the land, and her beauty so great that even stones were moved to tears simply by her gaze. These two Goddesses, bound in their fate, inevitably fell in love. And so it came to be that the First Peace allowed harmony between all species. It is said that on their wedding day, the people gathered at [[the Well]] and a celebration began that lasted over a week. This is why we gather for the Midwinter Festival.

It was also the discovery of the [[lifeblood]] that brought about the [[Mechaknights]] - a metallic race from far beyond this realm, near the bottom of the Well.  Through their magic, it was told to Solip that these people were the original guardians of the Rainforest, and so she and her people gave them no trouble. When they awoke, they were allowed to resume their guardianship over the Rainforest with ease, their strength and loyalty to the forest proof enough of their origin. On that day, a prophecy was foretold that one day a terrible and powerful force would emerge, one that would burn the Rainforest and bury its [[wells]], enslaving their people and leaving nothing but sand and ruin its wake. 

Though the goddesses were the rulers of this land, it did have a few other inhabitants. Most notably, the kingdom of Man, hailing from the [[land beyond the sea]], which was at this time small in number, and confined entirely to a very small clearing at the northernmost edge of the realm. These people had arrived here long after the goddesses and the Halflings, and possessed an insatiable desire for conquest. Their ruler went by the name of [[Malias The Brutal]], a name he had earned through his brutal treatment of prisoners after winning a great deal of land for his people. At first, the goddesses thought nothing of them, mere travelers from another realm.

As time passed and the kingdom of Man grew in number, its people began to grow restless. Though still making up a small fraction of the population, humanity wanted more. They felt that they had outgrown their small clearing in the north, and began to demand Solip and her guardians open up more land for their constructions. Knowing the deal that they had made, however, the two queens never gave in. They feared what might happen if the balance of the Rainforest were to be upset, they feared what was prophesized to them.

They were told what would happen, but the humans cared not. They cared only for gaining more land, killing more trees, and building more factories to fuel their endless war machine. To them, the land underneath was valuable. There were endless resources for them to extract. 

Inevitably it came to pass that the two goddesses, along with the last of the [[Mechaknights]], found themselves embroiled in a war with [[Malias The Brutal]] and his men. This was something they knew they could not keep up, as with each tree the humans cut, each area they burnt down for farmland, each well they drained for fuel, the lifeblood rotted them further. Eventually, only the southernmost regions of the Rainforest remained, standing tall as the last sanctuary life, a monument to the beauty of what was. 

The two queens would eventually be captured, and spent their last days rotting away in a cell, far away from their beloved forest. Eventually, when [[Malias The Brutal]] was certain they were dead once and for all, their bodies were cast into the well at which they had made their first promise, the last well which remains to this very day. The well was left with a very small amount of lifeblood in it, so that we [[Halflings]] could stay alive, even if only barely, and serve as a good workforce for the now [[Imperator]]. It is the [[lifeblood]], after all, which keeps us from succumbing to [[Rot]]. 

And so the prophecy was realized. The perfect harmony which the goddesses upheld was destroyed almost overnight. [[Malias The Brutal]] and his men sealed the Well, returning home to their kingdom and taking with them the entirety of those who remained in the [[Rainforest]]. 


NOTES: 

Why would they not drain the entire well? I know it says to keep Halflings alive, but why simply leave the Well abandoned instead of keeping control of / track of it?

A: Well, there's not even any guarantee that this story is completely true. Even if they had done that, after 3 or 4 thousand years of slavery, and a long period of almost no growth in the [[Rainforest]], its not unreasonable to assume that they would just simply have lost track of it over the years. Especially with how regressive and anti-tech the empire is, it makes it very hard for them to do anything meaningful in what's left of the Rainforest. 

In another book, more detail will be put into the founding of [[The University]]. For many many many years the [[Halflings]] were just a slave race, along with the [[Mechaknights]], and the [[Rainforest]] was thought to be diminishing. Very few free communities of [[Halflings]] existed, and they were shrouded in total mystery, never leaving the little enclaves they built in the [[Rainforest]]. 

The first [[Archmage]] would eventually stumble across [[the Well]] after exploring for nearly their entire life to find it, and from there [[The University]] began to be formed, as they rebuilt [[the Well]] and worked to free enslaved Halflings. It was not until the last thousand or so years that [[The University]] actually existed. They were not around at the beginning - it was only human empires fighting over increasingly limited resources. 

Q: What about the mechaknights? What is supposed to have happened to them after this?

A: Again, assuming this story is even true (it probably isnt, neither of the people's religious books are meant to be taken as 100% fact by the player and the truth is definitely somewhere between them), they would have been enslaved in the same way the Halflings were, the ones who didn't hide somewhere in the rainforest or go insane anyway.
