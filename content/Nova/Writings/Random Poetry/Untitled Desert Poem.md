Once, I met a wanderer from a far off land,
Who told me tales of distant ruins,
Kingdoms shaded by Rainforest
Where kings once stood and screamed
"We are here! The gods shall bow to our names!"
But where no names remain,
In their place grows only vines
Wrapped tightly around the waists
Of towers long lost to time

Sand dunes crash like waves against sea
How I long to see home again. . .
