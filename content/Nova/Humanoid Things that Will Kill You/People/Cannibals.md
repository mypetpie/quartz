Members of one of many human tribes residing around the continent of Nova. This is a page about  the specific variations of cannibals in terms of enemy types - for more general information about cannibals see [[Cannibal Tribes]].

These people tend to be hyper-aggressive, and stalk unsuspecting squads of people relentlessly. They possess essentially no difference from humans in terms of combat capability, and often use basic weapons such as [[Spear]]s and bows that appear to have been mostly looted off of their previous victims. There are three main types of cannibals you can encounter in your travels: Archers, Warriors, and Priests. 

CANNIBAL WARRIORS:
A "cannibal warrior" is basically your generic cannibal enemy/NPC type. They carry a melee weapon that can range from a club to a katana, and wield them all with about the same brute-force efficiency. Any cannibal you see that is not carrying a bow, or wielding a staff and doing some kind of ritual to a prisoner, is labeled as a warrior. 

physical desc: 

These guys are completely naked, covered only by paint (assumed to be made from the blood of their captives) which forms strange, unrecognizable symbols from head to toe. Their only piece of "clothing" is a sash, which they tie around their wastes like a belt in order to keep their axe in place when they aren't using it.

CANNIBAL ARCHERS:
Basically the same as cannibal warriors, but instead they carry bows. The bows they carry don't tend to be fancy though, often being very primitive looking and weak compared to the average bow.

CANNIBAL PRIESTS:
The cannibal priest will be the apparent leader of whatever camp you happen across. They are most well-defined by their appearance, wearing a long, blood-red robe, some kind of skull with horns on it, and carrying a staff. When a character occupies one of the many cells they store their prisoners in at their camps, a priest will come by to "bless" them - really all this is is them robbing the player of their possessions before they kill them though.
