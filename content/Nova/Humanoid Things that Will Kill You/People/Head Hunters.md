Without a doubt one of the meanest, nastiest groups of people you could happen to come across in the wastes. Employed by the [[Slavers]], they are paid to travel all over the continent and "enforce the law of the land" on its inhabitants. Should you find yourself in their company, you better hope you look wealthy enough or strong enough to fend them off, otherwise they will probably label you a criminal or escaped slave and then you'll be marked until they catch you. 

Luckily, there are a few safe spaces for people seeking refuge from these guys - most notably cities within [[The University]]'s territory. 


Physical desc: 

These guys are obviously always human and always male, because anybody else is seen as a potential slave and thus are not allowed to become slave hunters. That just wouldn't make any sense. For armor, these guys are usually decked out in your traditional steel chestplates and helmets - not unlike the knights of [[The God-Hand]], since they hail from the same region. For legs, they usually have some kind of very basic leather padding and a pair of steel boots and not much more. They're a bit like the walmart looking version of the knights of [[The God-Hand]].
