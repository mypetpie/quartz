A very hot, barely habitable strech of land that takes up the vast majority of the continent. Nothing grows here, and carnivorous insects and [[Head Hunters]] roam the land looking for their next victim. Despite its harshness, this is the climate region where basically all people in Nova live.


--How do they adapt?--

For the most part, people that are born in the desert are generally born as peasants living within or very close to a settlement controlled by one of the major factions, which guarentees them some amount of physical safety from the outside world. As such, most people never leave their cities in order to avoid the possibility of being eaten alive, or worse. Conditions in these cities are objectively awful, with many people living in crudely constructed huts made from whatever materials have been scavenged (mostly mud bricks/sandstone), living in the shadow of some fortress that's built to house those more important than them. 

Food and other necessary supplies are generally extremely hard to come across, as almost nothing will grow due to the harsh climate, dry weather, and long infertile soil. As such, these cities rely very heavily on trade from the [[Trade Guild]] to supply them with food, water, clothes, etc. that come from the much more fertile [[Plains]] region they have control over.
