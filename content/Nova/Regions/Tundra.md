A cold, wintery biome that takes up much of the northern and north-western(ish) coast of the [[Map]]. Similar to the desert in that not a lot of plants are able to grow here, however the key difference is that here the ground is frozen solid so there's no threat of things like [[Desert Crawler]]s or [[Sand Pincher]]s coming up from beneath the ground. Instead, most of the threats here are [[Human]]. [[Cannibal Priest]]s and their tribes stalk the land, looking for stray travelers to take back to their camp. Because the [[Confederation of Free Cities]]'s influence and power really only extends a little bit outside of each city, this area tends to be basically lawless. Be prepared for frequent stops by [[Bandit Tribes]].
