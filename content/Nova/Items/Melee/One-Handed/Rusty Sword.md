"It's just a plain old rusty sword, nothing special about it. Whoever had this before you probably met an untimely end. Better than nothing, I guess..."


A short, one-handed sword with a base damage of 5, that does not spawn with a [[Weapon Quality]] above "destroyed" or "relic". The weapon of choice for anyone with no money, since they can be found on the corpse of basically every dead bandit that had a sword before you killed them.
