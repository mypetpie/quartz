Throughout the world of Nova, there are a wide variety of various ruins that have been lost to time, waiting to be discovered. Some of these include:


[[abandoned sanctuaries]]
[[ruined forts]]



--NOTE: (most of the ruins that would be considered to have been from EXPLICITLY BEFORE THE AGE OF FIRE are buried extremely deep within the jungle, are infested with horrifying insect creatures, and contain extremely weird/unexplainable and highly sought after research gear and equipment. Including but not limited to: staffs, spell-books, etc.. These can be sold in [[Tech Shops]], in towns where magic is not illegal. )
