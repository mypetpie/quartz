A general, all-purpose [[Trade Guild]] [[Shops]] that sells basically anything the average wanderer might need - the exact stock of these stores depends on where you are. For instance, you can buy [[Gas Mask]]s in [[The University]]'s general store, but the [[Confederation of Free Cities]] and [[The Kingdom of Man]] don't sell these, since travel to the [[Rainforest]] is strictly prohibited. Mostly, the General Store sells things like [[food]], [[medkit]]s, and basic [[Clothing]] items.
