A generic shop that sells armor. The style of these stores, as well as the armor (and the quality of armor) they sell, varies greatly depending on the region that one happens to be in. For instance, if you find yourself in a University [[Bazaar]] armor shop, you are likely to find robes, cloaks, leather, and other light armors. But, if you're in an armor shop ran by someone in the [[Confederation of Free Cities]], you might find leather and mail stuff, lighter armors which are good for stealth and speed. In [[The Kingdom of Man]], you're more likely to find plate armor, knight's gear, and other heavier styles of armor. See more about the quality provided by these armor shops in the "shop info" tab of each specific city.
